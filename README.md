## Background

This is an experiment notebook of recreating a simplified version of the Youtube Recommendation Algorithm
I am aware it is a better idea to denote a score for each item, making recommendations more accurate and easier to perform.
But I have never done binary recommendation...so I kinda wanna try it out...never do it again though.

The enclosed notebook serves as evidence of my capabilities in the following areas:

* 2-Layers Recommendation Algorithm (matrix factorization & neural collaborative filtering)
* Using Metrics to Evaluate Recommendation
* Optimizing Recommendation Speed

## Results

An improved Recomender with an AUC of 0.58 (not very high but decent for Internet URLs) that could recommend content for users in less than 0.65 seconds.
